- Display ERROR: Failed to screenshot, what should I do?

- The fault is divided into the following cases:

1. If shape=0,0,4, then please make sure that the original God window is not minimized.

2. If shape=xxx,xxx,4, then please confirm that the resolution of Yuanshin God is 1080p, and confirm that the Yuanshin God launcher window is closed.

3. 如果你在windows设置了缩放且缩放不是百分百，请在设置中将`强制忽略截图大小检测`关闭。同时，GIA不会对截图有效性进行完整检测，请自行确定原神启动器关闭，否则会导致故障。 $WAITING_FOR_TRANSLATE
