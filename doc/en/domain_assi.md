## Introduction

- It can automatically and continuously brush most of the secret realms, including automatically starting challenges, automatically fighting and automatically receiving rewards.

- Press `]` to enable or disable automatic rifts.

- Before starting the automatic secret realm function, please configure the automatic battle lineup first. For the part of automatic combat, please refer to [Automatic Combat Assist](combat_assi.md)

- Requires Genshin Impact to run windowed at 1080p. Color filters are not recommended.

## Instructions

1. Set the number of challenges and other settings in the config, see [config settings] (config.md)

2. Manually select the team, configure the team, and enter the secret realm.

3. After entering the secret realm, press the `]` key to start brushing~

## Precautions

1. Select a team first, then activate after entering the secret realm.

2. The program recognizes the direction based on the small map in the upper left corner. During the process from entering the secret realm to starting the challenge, the small map is required to calibrate the standard direction, so do not move the mouse during this process.

3. Use Raw Resin to get rewards.

4. When challenging in Liyue or some of the petrified ancient trees are blocked by walls, please set `isLiYueDomain` to `true` in `config.json`.
